## ðŸŒ¿ Cotton Leaf Disease Detection
This repository contains two deep learningâ€“based models â€” ResNet50 and VGG16 â€” for detecting 7 types of cotton leaf diseases using the SAR-CLD-2024 dataset.

The models are trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated to achieve high accuracy for practical agricultural applications.
